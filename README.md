> > The DICE model views climate change in the framework of economic growth theory. In a standard neoclassical optimal growth model known as the Ramsey model, society invests in capital goods, thereby reducing consumption today, to increase consumption in the future. [...] The model optimizes a social welfare function, W, which is the discounted sum of the population-weighted utility of per capita consumption.
